# Contributing to Student-Performance-Analysis-and-Clustering

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Student-Performance-Analysis-and-Clustering** project!  
This open-source repository focuses on analysing academic performance data and applying clustering methods to segment students based on behaviour, outcomes and demographic features. Every contribution — no matter how small — is warmly welcomed.



## 🚀 How You Can Contribute

- **Data & Feature Enhancements**: Add new student datasets, refine cleaning, improve feature engineering (for example: study hours, parental education, extracurricular participation, learning environment).  
- **Clustering & Segmentation Improvements**: Experiment with different clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical), optimise parameters, validate cluster quality, or generate actionable segment profiles.  
- **Visualization & Dashboards**: Create compelling visuals or interactive dashboards showing student segments, performance distributions, cluster insights and recommendations.  
- **Documentation & Tutorials**: Improve the README, add clear walkthroughs, explain the methodology and code, and provide example notebooks for newcomers.  
- **Bug Fixes & Code Optimisation**: Fix issues in notebooks/scripts, simplify pipelines, ensure reproducibility and improve performance.
